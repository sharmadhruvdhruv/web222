        <p class="ME1">Hello everyone, myself Dhruv Sharma. This is my second Semester going on in Seneca College as an International Student. At Seneca, I am studying computer programming and analysis. I always wanted to work in IT industry thus, I chose this course in Seneca. By Nature, I am an extrovert type of person and love to meet new people to learn new things and have different kind of experiences in my life. My hobbies include- singing, badminton, reading, travelling, working out and of course experimenting with computer systems. This web page is everything that I have learnt in this course. From the beginning of this semester, I had keen interest in this subject. Apart from the notes, I research on my own on different things that professor taught us. I am quick learner and keen observant. In my high school, I participated in each activity from sports to IT Olympiads to singing competitions and that is the reason my friends used to call me all-rounder. After completing this final assessment. I find myself confident enough to design something beautiful out of nothing. I also like to play games and I always wonder how these high-end graphic games are designed. In future, I want to see myself capable enough to know the science behind these applications and want to design even more better applications and I hope with Seneca, this dream would be fulfilled one day. That is all about me.

        <p class="data">These four months of learning web development using html, JavaScript and CSS has taught me a lot new things which I believe in future will play important role in my life because we all know, if the base is strong then only we can think of going beyond our limits to try and develop something new. My experience with learning these languages was pretty good. At first, it was difficult to cope up with the new concepts altogether however, when I dedicated time to invest in this course then things turned out differently. I started to learn things quickly and imply them to my assignments and projects. I experimented with things that professor used to make us learn in class on my own to discover something new and that fascinated me a lot. I learnt about different topics like how to add images, audio, external links from different web sites and many more things. Notes that were provided by the professor sometimes created trouble for me because there is a lot of stuff which cannot be covered all of the sudden and I always want pace in everything which made it difficult for me to get through some topics for some time. Though, I always tried learning as much as possible. There were many ups and down in these four weeks and I also missed one assignment due to some reason but I know as long as I am learning concepts, itâ€™s good for me to move further and to focus on next tasks. Mr. Lehal is a supportive professor, and he was very kind during all the semester. He helped me a lot when I required extensions because of genuine reasons. Thus, I really appreciate him for being such a nice professor. After this semester, I have planned to go through some concepts because I am still learning things even after completing the course, I want to overcome my short comings in future. Overall, I had an amazing experience with everyone in this course. My classmates were also very supportive throughout the semester. This is everything that I have learnt in this course. I wish, I could fulfil my dreams in coming future with all the knowledge I have grasped till now from this course and make my parents, friends and professors proud on me.  </p>
